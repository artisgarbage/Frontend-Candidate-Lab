## Serving Files Locally


``` npm install; bower install; gulp; gulp serve; ```

OR just

```gulp serve``` (which will also start a watch task)


## Notes

* The Polaroids could easily be lightened and abstracted by getting a good BG texture of those images, then just translating them around...
* There are a few proportions aspect ratios that could probably still use some work, would probably work on target devices going forward...
* Was missing the fonts, otherwise I would have refined text styling
